Tasks for WEEK 02


	* "Read" PDF "01_IRIS.pdf" and respond to questions "02_dataset.txt".  Many times we need to learn to "SCAN" documents to glean what we need without fully reading the entire document.  We are going to need information from the first 24 pages or so.  This homework will also use the dataset "personality".  In total it will be worth 15 points.
	* Submit your "handout" for Project 01 "measure".  I would suggest using the XLS file and performing the measurements on yourself this week so you can best build the handout so it is easy to understand and efficient to complete.
	* Interact with Lecture for DAY 03 "n > 1" and take appropriate notes in your thought journal:  https://youtu.be/
	* Interact with Lecture for DAY 04 "new normal" and take appropriate notes in your thought journal:  https://youtu.be/
	* Optional video:  learn how to setup a linux (debian) virtualbox to run inside Windows 10:  https://youtu.be/

Weekly Zoom office hours will be held on Mondays at 1PM and Thursdays at 8PM.  The goal is to offer varying times to accomodate the different needs you may have.  An appointment for other office hours can be arranged.  Ideally, create a group of 4-5 total students and make a group request for office hours.
