The method includes: collecting data of the continuous annealing process including roll speed, current and tension of an entry loop (ELP); building a model using the RKPCA and updating the model, and calculating the eigenvectors {circumflex over (p)}. In the fault detection of the continuous annealing process, when the T2 statistic and SPE statistic are greater than their confidence limit, a fault is identified; on the contrary, the whole process is normal. The method mainly solves the nonlinear and time-varying problems of data, updates the model and calculates recursively the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the training data covariance by the RKPCA.

For example, a method comprises optimizing one or more parameters of a natural language processing system so as to improve a measure of quality of an output of the natural language processing system for a first type of data processed by the natural language processing system while maintaining a given measure of quality of an output of the natural language processing system for a second type of data processed by the natural language processing system. For example, the first type of data may have a substantive complexity that is greater than that of the second type of data. Thus, when the natural language processing system is a machine translation system, use of a conditional value at risk metric for the translation quality provides for a high quality output of the machine translation system for data of a high substantive complexity (for sophisticated users) while maintaining an average quality output for average data (for average users).\n","series_code":"13\/073,255","related":"","CPCs":["G06F","G06F"],"_date-filed_":"2011-03-28","date-filed":"March 28, 2011","date-issued":"","date-published":"October 4, 2012","app_number":"","firms":[{"city":"Armonk","country":"US","location":"Armonk, US","name":"International Business Machines Corporation"}],"inventors":null,"datetype":"date published","date-filed-utc":1298871337000},"2130030792":{"docid":2130030792,"document":"20130030792","title":"Customization of a Natural Language Processing Engine","abstract":"A method, an apparatus and an article of manufacture for customizing a natural language processing engine.

Multiple parallel domain pipelines are used for processing a natural language input. Each domain pipeline represents a different specific subject domain of related concepts. Each domain pipeline includes a mention module that processes the natural language input using natural language understanding (NLU) to determine a corresponding list of mentions, and an interpretation generator that receives the list of mentions and produces a rank-ordered domain output set of sentence-level interpretation candidates. A global evidence ranker receives the domain output sets from the domain pipelines and produces an overall rank-ordered final output set of sentence-level interpretations.\n","series_code":"13\/711,814","related":"","CPCs":["G06F"],"_date-filed_":"2012-12-12","date-filed":"December 12, 2012","date-issued":"","date-published":"June 12, 2014","app_number":"","firms":[{"city":"Burlington","country":"US","location":"Burlington, US","name":"Nuance Communications, Inc."}],"inventors":[{"last_name":"Hebert","location":"Melocheville, CA","name":"Hebert; Matthieu","city":"Melocheville","first_name":"Matthieu","country":"CA"},{"last_name":"Robichaud","location":"Mercier, CA","name":"Robichaud; Jean-Philippe","city":"Mercier","first_name":"Jean-Philippe","country":"CA"},{"last_name":"Parisien","location":"Montreal-Ouest, CA","name":"Parisien; Christopher M.","city":"Montreal-Ouest","first_name":"Christopher M.","country":"CA"},{"last_name":"Duta","location":"Winchester, US","name":"Duta; Nicolae","city":"Winchester","first_name":"Nicolae","country":"US"},{"last_name":"Tremblay","location":"Montreal, CA","name":"Tremblay; Jerome","city":"Montreal","first_name":"Jerome","country":"CA"},{"last_name":"Almahairi","location":"Montreal, CA","name":"Almahairi; Amjad","city":"Montreal","first_name":"Amjad","country":"CA"},{"last_name":"Kaushik","location":"Allen, US","name":"Kaushik; Lakshmish","city":"Allen","first_name":"Lakshmish","country":"US"},{"last_name":"Boisvert","location":"Montreal, CA","name":"Boisvert; Maryse","city":"Montreal","first_name":"Maryse","country":"CA"}],"datetype":"date published","date-filed-utc":1352698540000},"2150170084":{"docid":2150170084,"document":"20150170084","title":"AUGMENTING BUSINESS PROCESS EXECUTION USING NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING","abstract":"A system, and computer program product for augmenting business process execution using natural language processing are provided in the illustrative embodiments Information related to a state in a business process is extracted from the business process executing in a data processing system.

The alert source, such as a telephone, personal computer or emergency sensor system, generates an alert signal containing information regarding an emergency situation. The first communication network communicates the alert signal from the alert source to the MON supervisory system. The MON supervisory system receives the alert signal and generates an alert message which includes audio message data and destination data. The destination data indicates a destination of the audio message data. The audio message data may contain a voice announcement providing information or instructions regarding the emergency situation. The second communication network communicates the alert message from the MON supervisory system to the SRBN system. The SRBN system extracts the destination data and the audio message data from the alert message, formats the audio message data for transmission via a satellite uplink, and transmits the audio message data via the satellite uplink to SRBN satellites. One or more of the MON communication units receive the audio message data transmitted from the SRBN satellites and generate an analog audio signal based on the audio message data.\n","series_code":"11\/954,434","related":"","CPCs":["H04B","G01S","G01S","G08B","G08B"],"_date-filed_":"2007-12-12","date-filed":"December 12, 2007","date-issued":"","date-published":"August 7, 2008","app_number":"","firms":null,"inventors":null,"datetype":"date published","date-filed-utc":1194845760000},"2120282875":{"docid":2120282875,"document":"20120282875","title":"DISABLING TRANSCEIVERS WHILE SERVICING EMERGENCY MESSAGES","abstract":"A method for servicing emergency messages by a user equipment (UE) is described.
