The method includes: collecting data of the continuous annealing process including roll speed, current and tension of an entry loop (ELP); building a model using the RKPCA and updating the model, and calculating the eigenvectors {circumflex over (p)}. In the fault detection of the continuous annealing process, when the T2 statistic and SPE statistic are greater than their confidence limit, a fault is identified; on the contrary, the whole process is normal. The method mainly solves the nonlinear and time-varying problems of data, updates the model and calculates recursively the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the training data covariance by the RKPCA. The results show that the method can not only greatly reduce false alarms, but also improve the accuracy of fault detection.\n","series_code":"13\/391,775","related":"","CPCs":["G06F","G05B"],"_date-filed_":"2011-07-07","date-filed":"July 7, 2011","date-issued":"","date-published":"February 7, 2013","app_number":"","firms":null,"inventors":[{"last_name":"Zhang","location":"Shenyang City, CN","name":"Zhang; Yingwei","city":"Shenyang City","first_name":"Yingwei","country":"CN"},{"last_name":"Yongdong","location":"Shenyang City, CN","name":"Yongdong; Teng","city":"Shenyang City","first_name":"Teng","country":"CN"},{"last_name":"Zhiyong","location":"Shenyang City, CN","name":"Zhiyong; Hu","city":"Shenyang City","first_name":"Hu","country":"CN"}],"datetype":"date published","date-filed-utc":1307449695000},"2160192004":{"docid":2160192004,"document":"20160192004","title":"METHOD, SYSTEM, AND RECORDING MEDIUM FOR MEASURING EFFECT OF PROVIDING INFORMATIONAL DATA","abstract":"Provided is a method, system, and non-transitory recording medium for analyzing the effect of providing informational data.

In contrast, existing processes for making non-vitrified fly ash masonry units cannot make products durable\u2014passing the 50 freeze\/thaw cycles required by ASTM. By using the process specified in this invention, fly ash can be made into durable bricks and other products without having to heat the green products in kilns at high temperature, thereby reducing energy consumption and costs associated with making ordinary clay bricks. The process resulted from a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF), which demonstrated that durable, non-vitrified, fly ash masonry units can be produced by using this process. Since fly ash is a material generated in large quantity at coal-fired power plants and since currently (in 2006) only about a third of the fly ash generated in the United States is used with the rest being disposed of as solid waste, use of fly ash to make bricks and other construction products not only has commercial value but also helps to reduce and to recycle wastes generated at coal-fired power plants. Furthermore, use of such non-vitrified (non-fired) fly ash products in the future reduces the use of fired clay products, which require using fossil fuel to heat the units in kilns, which in turn generates air pollution and carbon dioxide that causes greenhouse effect and global warming. Therefore, use of the fly ash brick invented here has the additional advantage of being environmentally friendly\u2014reducing air pollution and global warming. \n","series_code":"11\/307,023","related":"","CPCs":["C04B","C04B","C04B","C04B","C04B","C04B","C04B","C04B"],"_date-filed_":"2006-01-19","date-filed":"January 19, 2006","date-issued":"","date-published":"January 4, 2007","app_number":"","firms":[{"city":"Columbia","country":"US","location":"Columbia, US","name":"FREIGHT PIPELINE COMPANY"}],"inventors":null,"datetype":"date published","date-filed-utc":1134995308000},"2120044502":{"docid":2120044502,"document":"20120044502","title":"DEVICE FOR DIVIDING AN OPTICAL BEAM INTO FOUR BEAMS AND NON-CONTACT OPTICAL PROFILOMETER COMPRISING SAME","abstract":"An optical probe for splitting a beam of light into multiple beams.
