For most entrepreneurs, assessing the merit of their idea can be a difficult undertaking.  Whether they have an invention and want to see if it is novel and worthwhile to file a patent application (which in itself is a rather expensive process) or they want to launch a product and want to be certain (or their investors want to be certain) that the idea is free of encumbrances from other existing intellectual property, thorough due diligence can be an arduous and seemingly interminable chore.  In the U.S. alone, there are over 10 million patent documents growing by about 15,000 additional documents every week.  Inundated with so much information, how can can interested parties effectively ascertain the merit of an idea?  Current patent-search tools place more of a burden on resource-constrained entrepreneurs, requiring the learning of another business-related task that may distract from the initiatives that advance the R&D.  Our innovation addresses this burden by automating the entire patent search-synthesis-analyis process informing the entrepreneur of potentially relevant existing patent documents in mere minutes for $99.  Our current minimal viable product allows a user to enter their idea (e.g., a 5-page invention disclosure, a 15-page grant proposal, a 40-page white paper, or even a 200-page dissertation) and "et voila", 10 minutes later a report is sent to their email and/or phone.  Precious time is no longer wasted on seemingly boundless searching so that it can be focused on actual research of relevant documents; that is, "From Search To Research With Fast Patent-document Correlations."  In 10 minutes  for $99, an interest party receives an executive summary, two-page, patent-search report (with bonus materials).  The report summarizes key attributes of the intellectual-property landscape (firms, inventors, technologies) and pinpoints a short list of patent documents that need to be carefully reviewed.
